A parkour game where you run away from elmo! With a leaderboard.

## The Game ##
Your goal is to run as far as you can before falling down or elmo eating you. Kind of like temple run (If you know what that is, pog).

* WASD to move
  * W - Forward
  * A - Left
  * S - Backward
  * D - Right
* Use mouse to look around
* P - Pause
* Ctrl-R - Restart

There are powerups to help you along the way. This includes:
* Yellow powerup - Gives you a speed boost
* Blue powerup - Gives you a jump boost
* Red powerup - Lets you fly
* White powerup - "Scares" elmo, makes him go away.

There are also different kinds of platforms:
* Normal platforms - A basic platform which does not move
* Rotating platforms - Platforms that rotate (can be in almost any direction)
* Moving platforms - Moves right and left or up and down
* Disappearing platform - Platform that disappears after some time standing on it

Make sure to check out the leaderboard at `/leaderboard`. If you want your name on it, make sure to login with replit ;).

## Feedback (Work in Progress) ##
* Currently working on achievements 
* ~~Add sensitivity option~~ (Done 6/13/2021)
* Add arrow or some way to indicate which way to go at the start.
* Github auth (because only 9 year olds use replit)
